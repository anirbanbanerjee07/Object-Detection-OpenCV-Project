## 🔍 Overview
This project aims to demonstrate various object detection techniques using OpenCV. You will find implementations using traditional methods (like Haar Cascades) as well as modern deep learning approaches (like YOLO and SSD).

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You also need to install the following libraries:

pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib tensorflow keras

### Clone the Repository
To get started, clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/anirbanbanerjee07/Object-Detection-OpenCV-Project.git
cd object-detection-opencv

## 🚀 Usage

To run the object detection script, execute:

python detect.py --image
path_to_your_image.jpg 

You can replace `path_to_your_image.jpg` with
